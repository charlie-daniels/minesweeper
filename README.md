# Minesweeper

## Overview

This is a command line python imitation of the game minesweeper.

### Details

Control input with coordinates in format (X,Y).

Type Q to exit build.

#### Key

- \+ ..... Hidden tile

- 0-8 ... Tiles with mines adjacent

- X ..... Mine

## Installation

For now, as this is still a work in progress, you can clone the repo and execute minesweeper.py to run it in the command line. This will be changed in future.

## More info

As this game is not complete, I have been using [minesweeperonline](https://minesweeperonline.com) to test the niche things and which is a good benchmark to compare this program to.
